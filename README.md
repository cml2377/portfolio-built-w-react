### Updated Portfolio

This site should still have all of the content it previously had:

* Name

* Links to my GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as my email address and phone number

* A link to a PDF of my resume with updated projects

* A list of projects. For each project, make sure I have the following:

  * Project title

  * Link to the deployed version

  * Link to the GitHub repository

  * GIF or screenshot of the deployed application


#### Design

As with the previous portfolio homework, "good" design is subjective. my site should look
"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

* Mobile-first design

* Choose a color palette for my site so it doesn't just look like
the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site. 

* Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

* If you want to go above and beyond, try using animations and react component libraries. Note 
that this will _not_ affect my grade, but it may impact how potentials employers gauge my knowledge.

### React

Additionally, this new portfolio should be created using React.

At a minimum, my portfolio should include the following:

* A `Header` component that appears on multiple pages

* A single `Project` component that will be used multiple times on a single page 

* Navigation with React Router, dynamic rendering, or another third part router

* A `Footer` component that appears on multiple pages
